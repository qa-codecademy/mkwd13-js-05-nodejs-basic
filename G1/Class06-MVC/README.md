# MVC Pattern in Node.js

## What is MVC?

**MVC (Model-View-Controller)** is a software architectural pattern that helps in organizing code by separating concerns. It is widely used in web applications to improve maintainability and scalability.

## Structure of MVC

The MVC pattern consists of three main components:

- **Model** – Represents the data and business logic. It manages the retrieval, processing, and updating of data.
- **View** – Handles the presentation layer. It receives data from the Controller and displays it to the user.
- **Controller** – Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It processes user input, interacts with the Model, and determines what the View should display.

## How MVC Works in Node.js

1. The **user sends a request** to the server (e.g., accessing a webpage or making an API call).
2. The **Controller handles the request**, processes any necessary business logic, and interacts with the Model.
3. The **Model retrieves or updates data** and sends it back to the Controller.
4. The **Controller sends the processed data** to the View.
5. The **View renders the response** and sends it to the user.

## Benefits of Using MVC in Node.js

- ✅ **Separation of Concerns** – Keeps code modular and easier to maintain.
- ✅ **Scalability** – Components can be extended or modified independently.
- ✅ **Reusability** – Business logic and UI components can be reused across different parts of the application.
- ✅ **Improved Collaboration** – Teams can work on different components (Model, View, Controller) without conflicts.

By using MVC in a Node.js application, developers can build structured, maintainable, and scalable web applications efficiently.

## Adding a service layer
A service layer is used to handle business logic separately from the controller.\
This improves maintainability by keeping controllers focused on handling requests and responses, while the service handles the core logic.\
The Service sits between the Controller and the Model, handling business logic before passing data to the controller.

How It Works with a service layer
1. The **user sends a request** to the server (e.g., accessing a webpage or making an API call).
2. The **Controller handles the request**, processes any necessary business logic, and interacts with the Service
3. The **Service interacts with the Model** to fetch or modify data.
4. The **Service returns data to the Controller**.
5. The **Controller sends the data to the View**, which renders the response.

Benefits of Adding a Service Layer
- ✅ **Better Separation of Concerns** – The controller only manages request handling, while the service takes care of the business logic.
- ✅ **Easier Testing** – Services can be tested independently from controllers.
- ✅ **Reusability** – The same service functions can be reused across different controllers or API endpoints.
- ✅ **Scalability** – Adding new business logic doesn’t clutter controllers.

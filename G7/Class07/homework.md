# Online Book Store PART 2 ðŸ“š

## Overview
This is a continuation of the [Book Store Project from Class 05](../Class05/homework.md).

## Requirements ðŸ“‹

Enhance the book store application by implementing the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.

### Core Tasks ðŸŽ¯

1. **Refactor Existing Code**
   - Restructure the solution from Part 1 using MVC pattern
   - Use the class examples as reference and inspiration

2. **Implement New Routes**
   - Create the following additional endpoints:
     * `GET /books/:id` - Retrieve a specific book by ID
     * `DELETE /books/:id` - Remove a book by ID
     * `PUT /books/:id` - Update a book by ID
       - All properties should be updatable
       - Maintain existing values for properties not included in the request body

## Submission Guidelines âœ…

- Complete implementation following MVC pattern
- Postman collection with all API endpoints
  - Add the collection file to your homework repository
